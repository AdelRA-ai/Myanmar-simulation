# 🇲🇲 Myanmar Scenario Simulator – Monte Carlo App

This interactive web application allows you to simulate geopolitical and humanitarian scenarios in Myanmar using Monte Carlo simulations.  
It is designed for analysts, humanitarian actors, and policy planners to explore the impact of strategic choices by key actors.

## 🧠 What it does

This Streamlit app simulates 10,000 potential scenarios based on probabilistic inputs for:

- China's positioning
- Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs)
- India, Bangladesh, Russia, and the USA

It estimates:
- Likely **political outcomes** (e.g., Prolonged Conflict, Fragile Negotiation)
- **Humanitarian impact levels** (e.g., High Needs, Severe Crisis)

Users can adjust probability sliders and instantly view:
- 📊 Outcome distributions
- 🚨 Humanitarian impact predictions
- 📥 Exportable data (CSV format)
